                                            sessions, given by international and local speakers, covering topics like biomedical
                                            engineering, recent space discoveries, IoT and others. In addition to the ‘Advanced
                                            Technical Sessions’ dedicated to technology enthusiasts to provide them with
                                            a deep understanding of certain topics. Non-technical workshops will be presented
                                            to help the attendees develop their soft skills. And finally our ‘Gallery’, which
                                            will be highlighting the latest technological innovations.
